# Introduction
After working with the Robstride motors for quite some time now, I determined it would be best to make it easier for everyone to use. This git combines knowledge from Brian Smith's already existing Rostride Python SDK as well as from Feather Robotics Inc. Feather Robotics (https://feather.dev/) develops and manufactures general-purpose robots that are viable for entrepreneurs to build a company around.

# Needed Hardware
In order to make use of this repo, one would need access to a Robstride Motor (O1, O2, O3 or O4), and a CAN transciever capable of utilizing socketcan.
